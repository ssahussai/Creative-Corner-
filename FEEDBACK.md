#### Feedback:  

Salma, you did an amazing job on your project!! You met all the technical requirements and you also built this solution around an amazing theme. 

I also really loved your implementation and styling as well! There were just a few things I suggest looking over. For example, there was a console.log and a couple of unused variables you'll want to remove from your controllers and routes. 

Also, for your image files, I recommend using lower case characters for your image file names. Lastly, you should also consider updating the link to your wireframes in your trello (I wasn't able to see them), also it's a good practice to add a link to your trello in your project's README!

All in all, excellent work, Salma! I look forward to seeing Project 3!
